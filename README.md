## 🧾 Dataset Summary

We used a dataset that includes:

- **Demographics:** Age, Income, Marital Status (and yes, people are still single 🥲)  
- **Campaign Response:** Who bought what, when, and how often  
- **Product Categories:** Wine, Meat, Gold (yes, people actually buy gold online)  
- **Spending Patterns:** Because someone has to keep the economy running

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python 🐍**  
- **Pandas** – Because Excel just wasn’t enough  
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** – For data plots that slap  
- **Plotly** – Interactive plots for the attention-deficit crowd  
- **Scikit-learn** – For clustering people into groups (socially acceptable here)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – The VIP section for data scientists
