## 📈 Business Problem

> As a marketing agency, we like *returns*—preferably the *investment* kind.

We ran campaigns on Facebook and Adwords to help our client reach more customers. But here's the catch: not all clicks are created equal. We need to know which ad platform is the MVP when it comes to **clicks, conversions, and cost-efficiency**. 🧐

Armed with this info, we can stop throwing money at underperforming platforms like it’s a New Year’s sale.

## ❓ Research Question

### **Which Ad Platform is more effective in terms of conversions, clicks, and overall cost-efficiency?**

Because nobody likes wasting ad budget on ghost clicks or low-converting traffic. Period.

- 📊 **Comparative Metrics:** 
    - Conversion Rate  
    - Click-Through Rate  
    - Cost per Click  
    - Cost per Conversion
- 🥇 **Results & Insights:** Called out the winner and backed it up with data.
